# CCataSound

The CCataSound project uses the open-source [Csound](https://csound.com) audio synthesis toolkit to
design and generate game sound effects and music for
[Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA).

Sounds and music in this repository are represented as plaintext Csound files, licensed under the
[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license.

This project is in the early development phase. So far only a few sound effects have been created as
a proof of concept.


## Usage

Install [Csound](https://csound.com) for your platform, and run `csound src/demo.csd` for a short
demonstration of existing sound effects, including exciting low-fi renditions of:

- Walking on dirt and grass
- Opening and closing a door
- Whiffing a stick through the air

Or you can skip installing and go to
[wapcaplet's Csound IDE page](https://ide.csound.com/profile/wapcaplet)
to hear the demo in your browser, or experiment with your own Csounds.
